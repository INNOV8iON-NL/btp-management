# Exercise 04 - Retrieving and parsing JSON output

At the end of this exercise, you'll know how to get the btp CLI to give you a more predictable and machine-readable output, which is especially helpful for combining the use of the btp CLI into automation and other scripts.

We'll retrieve information about the regions in which subaccounts can be created.

## List the available regions

Within the "accounts" group, there's an "available-region" object that can be listed.

ðŸ‘‰ Use the power of autocomplete that you set up in [Exercise 03](../03-autocomplete-and-exploration/README.md) to invoke this:

```bash
btp list accounts/available-region
```

The output should look something like this:

```

Showing available regions for global account fdce9323-d6e6-42e6-8df0-5e501c90a2be:

region   data center   environment    provider
ap21     cf-ap21       cloudfoundry   AZURE
us10     cf-us10       cloudfoundry   AWS
eu10     cf-eu10       cloudfoundry   AWS


OK

```

## Parsing the output

Traditional Unix commands output only the data requested, often with no frills. This is so the output, that often gets piped into a subsequent command, can be processed without issue. What you might want if you were intending to write a script to examine the possible regions and make a decision based upon what was available, is just the basic output:

```
ap21     cf-ap21       cloudfoundry   AZURE
us10     cf-us10       cloudfoundry   AWS
eu10     cf-eu10       cloudfoundry   AWS
```

In other words, this minimal output does not have the "Showing available regions..." message, the "OK" or any of the multiple blank lines we see in the previous output.

This is more akin to the Unix philosophy; what's more, the separation between the columns of output would likely be done via tab characters which are more readily parsed (especially by tools such as [cut](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man1/cut.1.html) which expect tab as the default separator) and are less likely to be part of the data columns.

There are many ways with the traditional Unix approach to trim the extra output from this btp CLI invocation, in order to reduce it to the basics. Here are two examples.

The first uses [sed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sed):

```
user: user $ btp list accounts/available-region 2> /dev/null | sed '1,/^region /d; /^$/d'
ap21     cf-ap21       cloudfoundry   AZURE
us10     cf-us10       cloudfoundry   AWS
eu10     cf-eu10       cloudfoundry   AWS
user: user $
```

The second uses [grep](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grep):

```
user: user $ btp list accounts/available-region 2> /dev/null | grep -E '^[a-z]{2}[0-9]+\s+'
ap21     cf-ap21       cloudfoundry   AZURE
us10     cf-us10       cloudfoundry   AWS
eu10     cf-eu10       cloudfoundry   AWS
user: user $
```

> The redirection of STDERR (with `2>`) to `/dev/null` in both of these examples is to get rid of the "OK" part of the result (and two of the blank lines), all of which are currently emitted to that error file descriptor.

These and many more approaches do the job, but they are somewhat brittle and depend on the data and the output. The challenge with each of the above two (deliberately simple) approaches are:

* the `sed` based solution relies on the "region" heading
* the `grep` based solution assumes the region identifiers are two lowercase letters followed by at least one digit, then some whitespace

## Use the JSON format output option

Some more recent command line tools deal with resources that are structured in ways that are sometimes too complex to be represented in plain text. The [JSON](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JSON) format is commonly used to express more structured data, and is often used as an alternative output format for commands.

JSON output is a more convenient way to convey structure, and can be parsed more reliably. JSON output is available from the btp CLI via the `--format json` option. The JSON output is more predictable and the team's aim is to keep it as stable as possible.

ðŸ‘‰ Rerun the previous btp CLI command but this time use the `--format json` option:

```bash
btp --format json list accounts/available-region
```

You should see something like this:

```json
{
  "datacenters": [
    {
      "name": "cf-ap21",
      "displayName": "Singapore - Azure",
      "region": "ap21",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AZURE",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-us10",
      "displayName": "US East (VA) - AWS",
      "region": "us10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-eu10",
      "displayName": "Europe (Frankfurt) - AWS",
      "region": "eu10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": false,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    }
  ]
}
```

> You'll also an "OK" surrounded by blank lines, but this is again sent to STDERR. From now on the executable examples will include redirecting STDERR to `/dev/null` to avoid the empty lines and "OK" - but bear in mind this is an extreme workaround because it would prevent any real errors from being displayed. This "OK" item output is being discussed internally.

### Parsing JSON output the wrong way

With the JSON output above, you might be tempted to parse the datacenter information as plain text, as the JSON appears naturally pretty-printed with properties and value pairs on separate lines. Here's an example of that:

```
$ btp --format json list accounts/available-region | grep displayName
      "displayName": "Singapore - Azure",
      "displayName": "China (Shanghai)",
      "displayName": "Canada (Toronto)",
      ...
```

DO NOT DO THIS.

JSON is not a plain text format, and while the structure and information in a JSON response is predictable and parseable, the whitespace is not guaranteed to be predictable.

The JSON output (taking the datacenter information we've seen already) could just as easily appear like this:

```
{"datacenters":[{"name":"cf-ap21","displayName":"Singapore - Azure","region":"ap
21","environment":"cloudfoundry","iaasProvider":"AZURE","supportsTrial":true,"pr
ovisioningServiceUrl":"https://provisioning-service.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.co
m","saasRegistryServiceUrl":"https://saas-manager.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com"
,"domain":"ap21.hana.ondemand.com","geoAccess":"BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"},{
"name":"neo-br1","displayName":"Brazil (SÃƒÂ£o Paulo)","region":"br1","environme
nt":"neo","iaasProvider":"SAP","supportsTrial":false,"provisioningServiceUrl":"h
ttps://cisservices.br1.hana.ondemand.com/com.sap.core.commercial.service.web","s
aasRegistryServiceUrl":null,"domain":"br1.hana.ondemand.com","geoAccess":"STANDA
RD"},{"name":"neo-cn1","displayName":"China (Shanghai)","region":"cn1","environm
```

Note that there wouldn't be the hard line breaks you see here (which are just so the data fits on the page width-wise) ... but any whitespace we saw earlier wouldn't be there either. Try getting any sensible output from that using `grep` now!

> If you're curious, this dense output was produced using normal UNIX commands: `btp --format json list accounts/available-region | jq -c . | fold -w80 | head`.

### Parsing JSON output the right way

Parsing JSON with the right tool is essential. Happily, it's also straightforward and can be very powerful and flexible.

One tool that is popular for this is [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/), which is described as "a lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor". It supports an entire language [which is Turing complete](https://github.com/MakeNowJust/bf.jq) but is readily useful at a simple level too. Your App Studio Dev Space comes already equipped with `jq` so you can try it out now.

ðŸ‘‰ Repeat the previous command, but this time pipe the output into `jq`, giving it a simple expression to list the names of the data centers:

```bash
btp --format json list accounts/available-region 2> /dev/null \
    | jq '.datacenters[].displayName'
```

This should produce output like this:

```
"Singapore - Azure"
"US East (VA) - AWS"
"Europe (Frankfurt) - AWS"
```

> `jq` always endeavors to produce JSON output - here, three valid JSON values are emitted (a double-quoted string is a valid JSON value). You can use the `-r` option to tell `jq` to emit raw strings if you want to avoid the double quotes.

**TODO - add more to this exercise**

## Summary

At this point you know how to get the btp CLI to output the structured data in a more machine-parseable format, and what you can do with that format.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. What Unix tool might you use to parse out the individual column values, say, to identify the region and provider values, from the text output in [Parsing the output](#parsing-the-output)?
