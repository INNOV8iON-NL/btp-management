# Exercise 09 - Deleting resources with the API

You've created resources with the btp CLI in the previous exercise, specifically a directory and a subaccount. In this exercise, to layer on a bit more experience and understanding, you're going to remove those resources using the appropriate API.

## Make the necessary preparations

It's worth double-checking what you're going to delete, and to get everything ready for action.

### Identify the directory and subaccount to delete

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look at the hierarchy of directories and subaccounts:

```bash
btp get accounts/global-account --show-hierarchy | trunc
```
