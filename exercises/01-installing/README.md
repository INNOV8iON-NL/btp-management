# Exercise 01 - Installing the btp CLI

At the end of this exercise, you'll have a comfortable command line environment within which to work, and the btp CLI installed and ready to invoke.

## Arrange your Dev Space

Throughout this hands-on session, you'll be working within the App Studio Dev Space that you set up when working through the [Session prerequisites](../../README.md#session-prerequisites).

### Why a Dev Space in App Studio?

Why a Dev Space in App Studio, and why a Basic one at that? Well, because it allows everyone to have the same environment, so we can all learn at the same pace and experience the same things. Moreover, App Studio Dev Spaces offer a VS Code like experience with a file explorer, version control interface, comfortable tabbed editor environment, and - most importantly for us - a modern terminal emulator.

The power of the btp CLI comes from multiple angles:

* it gives us comfortable and convenient access to the [BTP APIs](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPCloudPlatformCoreServices/rest)
* it is a command line tool, meaning it lets us stay within our development flow and can be combined with other developer and devops tools
* it is scriptable - we can make use of the btp CLI within shell scripts to create whatever automation we need relating to management of resources on BTP

App Studio Dev Spaces, even Basic ones, give us that essential command line context. So that's what we're using. By all means, after this session, feel free to install and use the btp CLI where it makes sense for you too.

### Clearing the Dev Space ready for work

Initially the Dev Space will look something like this:

This is lovely, but we want to focus on the command line, so let's remove everything to make as much space as possible for that command line.

ðŸ‘‰ Do the following:

* toggle the Explorer closed with menu path `View -> Explorer`
* close the Welcome tab with the `x` (optionally having checked the "Don't show this again" checkbox)
* open up a terminal session with menu path `Terminal -> New Terminal`
* optionally, open the Preferences with menu path `File -> Preferences -> Open Preferences`, find the font size setting for the terminal ("Terminal â€º Integrated: Font Size"), within Features / Terminal, and adjust as appropriate; close the Preferences tab when you're done with this
* drag the horizontal line up towards the top of the screen to give you maximum terminal space
* switch to the Problems tab which was also automatically opened, and close it with the `x`

> Notice that in the menu items you're shown keyboard shortcuts for some of the actions you're carrying out (e.g. opening a new terminal, or opening the preferences) - these can make the use of the Dev Space even more comfortable.

You should end up with your Dev Space looking more like this:

All set!

## Install the btp CLI

The btp CLI tool is available from the [SAP Development Tools](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/) website, specifically in the [Cloud](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud) section.

The basic way to install it is as described there - go to the page, work out which tarball to download, download it, expand and unpack it, extracting the executable into a place that you decide. You want it in a place that will be searched when you invoke it directly.

As a user in the terminal within the Dev Space, we don't have administrative access to be able to create files or directories except within our user space. So let's decide to put the executable in a `bin/` directory within our home directory, and add that to the `PATH` environment variable so that we can run it without specifying the full path.

So at this stage you have a choice.

* [follow the instructions](#follow-the-instructions) on the download page, choosing the `bin/` directory (i.e. `$HOME/bin/` which resolves to `/home/user/bin/` in the context of the Dev Space terminal session)
* [use the `getbtpcli`  script](#use-the-getbtpcli-script) to do this for you, a script that will let you discover and download the latest versions as they become available

ðŸ‘‰ In this exercise, follow the second approach and [use the `getbtpcli` script](#use-the-getbtpcli-script).

### Follow the instructions

If you do choose this approach, make sure you end up with

```
/home/user/bin/btp
```

as an executable file.

### Use the `getbtpcli` script

This script is part of an [SAP Tech Bytes](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes) topic, specifically [SAP btp CLI](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/tree/2021-09-01-btp-cli), and is available in the corresponding branch: [getbtpcli](https://github.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/blob/2021-09-01-btp-cli/getbtpcli).

ðŸ‘‰ Make sure you're in your home directory:

```bash
cd $HOME
```


ðŸ‘‰ Download the `getbtpcli` script and make it executable:
  ```bash
  curl \
    --remote-name \
    --location \
    --url "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SAP-samples/sap-tech-bytes/2021-09-01-btp-cli/getbtpcli" \
    && chmod +x getbtpcli
  ```
  > The `getbtpcli` script itself will be placed in whatever directory you happen to be in, which will be your home directory, which is fine. So you'll need to specify the relative path to it when running it, like this: `./getbtpcli`.

ðŸ‘‰ Run the script with the test mode option just to check what the latest version of the btp CLI is (the output will be something like "Version is 2.14.0"):
```bash
./getbtpcli --test
```

> If you're [going off piste](https://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/go-off-piste) and carrying out these exercises on macOS, please note that you'll need to have the "proper" GNU version of `grep` installed (see this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/59232089/how-to-install-gnu-grep-on-mac-os) entry for tips. especially the part about "needing to use these commands with their normal names"). Otherwise you may encounter errors. If you're running on a Windows based machine, then I'm afraid [I can't help you](https://dilbert.com/strip/1995-06-24), except perhaps to suggest using the [Windows Subsystem for Linux](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Windows_Subsystem_for_Linux) :-)

ðŸ‘‰ Run the script, to download, unpack and install the btp CLI:
```bash
./getbtpcli
```

Here's an example session where it's run in test mode first and then for real:

```
user: user $ ./getbtpcli --test
Version is 2.14.0
user: user $ ./getbtpcli
Proceed (with Enter) only if you accept the SAP Developer Licence 3.1
(see https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/developer-license-3_1.txt) ...
Version is 2.14.0
user: user $
```

## Add your bin directory to the PATH

You should now have the btp CLI available in your `$HOME/bin/` directory.

ðŸ‘‰ Take a look:

```bash
ls -l $HOME/bin/
```

You should see something similar to this:

```
lrwxrwxrwx 1 user group       10 Jan  6 09:59 btp -> btp-2.14.0
-rwxr-xr-x 1 user group 11048097 Nov 18 13:58 btp-2.14.0
```

Before you can run the btp CLI simply as `btp` you need to add that `bin/` directory to your `PATH` environment variable. To make this addition persistent, make the addition in the script that gets run each time you open up a new terminal session (more accurately, a new Bash shell session in the terminal) - the `.bashrc` file in your home directory.

ðŸ‘‰ In the next command, it's vital that you don't accidentally clobber your entire `.bashrc` file, so first take a copy of it:

```bash
cp $HOME/.bashrc /tmp/
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now append a line to the `.bashrc` file in your home directory which adds the `bin/` directory to the `PATH` environment variable - make sure you use the command as shown here, with the single quotes (not double quotes) and using the *append* redirection which is a double greater-than sign `>>`, and *not* a single one:

```bash
echo 'export PATH=$PATH:$HOME/bin' >> $HOME/.bashrc
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now, close the current session by typing in `exit` (or Ctrl-D) and start a new terminal session. This should cause the contents of `$HOME/.bashrc` to be executed, meaning that you should now have a `PATH` environment variable which contains your `bin/` directory.

ðŸ‘‰ Check this as follows:

```bash
user: user $ echo $PATH
/home/user/.node_modules_global/bin:/extbin/bin:/extbin/npm/docker/bin:/extbin/npm/globals/bin:/usr/local/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/bin:/sbin:/bin:/curl/bin:/home/user/bin
user: user $
```

You can also make life easier for yourself with [shell parameter expansion](https://www.gnu.org/software/bash/manual/html_node/Shell-Parameter-Expansion.html) and have each of the individual locations displayed on separate lines:

```bash
user: user $ echo -e ${PATH//:/\\\n}
/home/user/.node_modules_global/bin
/extbin/bin
/extbin/npm/docker/bin
/extbin/npm/globals/bin
/usr/local/sbin
/usr/local/bin
/usr/sbin
/usr/bin
/sbin
/bin
/curl/bin
/home/user/bin
user: user $
```

You can of course just check if `btp` can be found:

```bash
user: user $ which btp
/home/user/bin/btp
```

Now you can invoke `btp` with confidence from wherever you are, and in all future terminal sessions in your Dev Space.

ðŸ‘‰ Try it now:

```
user: user $ btp
Welcome to the SAP BTP command line interface (client v2.14.0)

Usage: btp [OPTIONS] ACTION [GROUP/OBJECT] [PARAMS]

CLI server URL:                    not set
User:                              not set
Configuration:                     /home/user/.config/.btp/config.json

You are currently not logged in.

Tips:
    To log in to a global account of SAP BTP, use 'btp login'. For help on login, use 'btp help login'.
    To display general help, use 'btp help'.

OK
```

ðŸ‘‰ While you're here, take a few moments to stare at this line, to get a feel for btp CLI invocations on the command line:

```
Usage: btp [OPTIONS] ACTION [GROUP/OBJECT] [PARAMS]
```

There's an SAP Help topic page linked in the [Further reading](#further-reading) section that explains how this is structured.


## Summary

At this point you have the btp CLI set up and ready to invoke from the command line.

## Questions

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. Expressing the individual locations within your `PATH` on separate lines was done using Bash shell parameter expansion. Using other command line tools, how else might you do it?
1. Is placing the `btp` executable within `$HOME/bin/` a good option? Will it still be there if you restart your Dev Space?
1. What help is available for the btp CLI on the command line? What does `btp --help` show you?
1. Why are there two entries in `$HOME/bin/` for the `btp` executable?
