# Exercise 07 - Making the API call

We've finally made it to the stage where we can make the call! The journey so far has been deliberately focused on the details that we need to pay attention to, so we understand what we're doing when we have to create a service key and make an OAuth 2.0 call to get an access token. Now we have that token, let's use it!

## Final preparation

We know that we want to make a call to the one endpoint in the Regions for Global Account group in the Entitlements Service API, i.e. to:

```text
/entitlements/v1/globalAccountAllowedDataCenters
```

and that we have an access token obtained through a successful completion of the OAuth 2.0 Resource Owner Password Credentials ("Password") flow.

The result of that process has left us with two files, both of which we still need.

|File|Content|What we need|
|-|-|-|
|`cis-central-sk.json`|Service key data|The Entitlements Service API base URL in `endpoints.entitlements_service_url`|
|`tokendata.json`|OAuth 2.0 data|The access token in `access_token`|

With your new `jq` filtering skills, tease out these two values to have a look at them.

ðŸ‘‰ First, have a look at the base URL:

```bash
jq --raw-output .endpoints.entitlements_service_url cis-central-sk.json
```

You should see something like this:

```text
https://entitlements-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com
```

ðŸ‘‰ Now have a quick look at the access token; use `jq`'s [string slice](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/#Array/StringSlice:.[10:15]) to only return a portion of it, because you don't need to see all of it, and it's better for security:

```bash
jq --raw-output '.access_token[:50]' tokendata.json
```

You should see something like this:

```text
eyJhbGciOiJSUzI1NiIsImprdSI6Imh0dHBzOi8vOGZlN2VmZD
```

## Make the call

You now have everything you need to make the call to the API endpoint. The simple script [call-entitlements-service-regions-api](call-entitlements-service-regions-api), also in this directory, will help you do this. Like the `generate-password-grant-type` script, it also requires the service key JSON data file (so it can retrieve the value of the `entitlements_service_url` endpoint) ... it also requires the name of the token data JSON file.

ðŸ‘‰ Have a look at the script if you wish, then invoke it, passing the output to `jq` to prettify it:

```bash
./call-entitlements-service-regions-api cis-central-sk.json tokendata.json | jq .
```

You should see some output similar to this:

```json
{
  "datacenters": [
    {
      "name": "cf-ap21",
      "displayName": "Singapore - Azure",
      "region": "ap21",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AZURE",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "ap21.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-us10",
      "displayName": "US East (VA) - AWS",
      "region": "us10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": true,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "us10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    },
    {
      "name": "cf-eu10",
      "displayName": "Europe (Frankfurt) - AWS",
      "region": "eu10",
      "environment": "cloudfoundry",
      "iaasProvider": "AWS",
      "supportsTrial": false,
      "provisioningServiceUrl": "https://provisioning-service.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "saasRegistryServiceUrl": "https://saas-manager.cfapps.eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "domain": "eu10.hana.ondemand.com",
      "geoAccess": "BACKWARD_COMPLIANT_EU_ACCESS"
    }
  ]
}
```

Does this [look familiar](#use-the-json-format-output-option)? Of course it does. It's exactly the same as what `btp --format json list accounts/available-region` produced.

## Summary

At this point you know how to get the btp CLI to output the structured data in a more machine-parseable form, and you also understand the relationship between the btp CLI and the Cloud Management Service APIs.

If you finish earlier than your fellow participants, you might like to ponder these questions. There isn't always a single correct answer and there are no prizes - they're just to give you something else to think about.

1. What other naming conventions for Cloud Foundry instances and service keys have you seen? Are there ones you prefer to use, and if so, what are they?
1. We used `sed` to strip off the unwanted first two lines of the service key output. How else might we have done this?
1. Take a look at the token data you retrieved - what's the lifetime of the access token, in hours?
1. Have a bit of a stare at the [call-entitlements-service-regions-api](call-entitlements-service-regions-api) script, and the associated [lib.sh](lib.sh) library. Is there anything in there that you'd like to know more about?
