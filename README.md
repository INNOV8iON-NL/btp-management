# Hands-on with the btp CLI and APIs

## Description

This repository contains the material for the "Hands-on with the btp CLI and APIs" CodeJam, a CodeJam within the [SAP CodeJam BTP group](https://groups.community.sap.com/t5/sap-codejam-btp/gh-p/codejam-btp).

## Overview

This CodeJam introduces attendees to `btp`, the CLI for the SAP Business Technology Platform (SAP BTP). Here's the description of the btp CLI from the [official download page](https://tools.hana.ondemand.com/#cloud): "_Use the btp CLI for account administration on SAP BTP. The btp CLI is only available for global accounts on feature set B (for example, SAP BTP Trial accounts)_".

It also introduces attendees to the APIs for SAP BTP, the Core Services for SAP BTP, which, [according to the SAP API Business Hub](https://api.sap.com/package/SAPCloudPlatformCoreServices/rest), allow you to "_manage, build, and extend the core capabilities of SAP BTP._"

## About this CodeJam

During this CodeJam, you'll learn how to harness the power of the btp CLI, as well as the core services APIs, to report on and manage resources on SAP BTP.

In the first part, you'll follow along with the session speaker installing, configuring & setting up the btp CLI, and authenticating with a BTP account. You'll then explore the btp CLI features and command structure, plus alternative output formats, autocompletion and more. Then you'll get comfortable navigating and creating resources within your BTP global account.

In the second part, you'll learn how to incorporate the btp CLI into shell scripts, so you can write custom utilities that suit your specific needs.

## Session prerequisites

In order to get the most from this CodeJam, and to be able to work through the exercises, there are certain prerequisites that you must have set up before the day of the CodeJam.

The prerequisites are detailed in a separate [prerequisites](prerequisites.md) file. Please ensure you work through these before attending the CodeJam.

## Exercises

These are the exercises, each in their own directory, sometimes with supporting files and scripts. We will work through the exercises in the order shown here. From a session flow perspective, we are taking the "coordinated" approach:

The instructor will set you off on the first exercise, and that's the only one you should do; if you finish before others, there are some questions at the end of the exercise for you to ponder. Do not proceed to the next exercise until the instructor tells you to do so.

> The exercises are written in a conversational way; this is so that they have enough context and information to be completed outside the hands-on session itself. To help you navigate and find what you have to actually do next, there are pointers like this ðŸ‘‰ throughout that indicate the things you have to actually do (as opposed to just read for background information).

## Scripts

There are a handful of scripts that are used and explored in this CodeJam, some of them are used in multiple exercises. To that end, they're collected together in a separate [scripts/](scripts/) directory and there are symbolic links pointing to them from the relevant exercise-specific directories where needed.

## Feedback

If you can spare a couple of minutes at the end of the session, please help the author improve for next time by providing some feedback.

Simply use this [Give Feedback](https://github.com/SAP-samples/cloud-btp-cli-api-codejam/issues/new?assignees=&labels=feedback&template=feedback-template.md&title=Feedback) link to create a special "feedback" issue, and follow the instructions in there.

Thank you!
